## Description
A **Kotlin application using Kafka Consumers with Spring Boot** is akin to having a network of super-efficient postal workers in this city. These postal workers (Kafka Consumers) are tasked with picking up, sorting, and delivering messages (data) that are constantly flowing into the city (your application) from various sources.

### How It Works

* `Receiving Messages`: Just as postal workers check the incoming mail, Kafka Consumers listen for messages on specific topics. With Spring Boot's Kafka support, setting up listeners for these topics is as easy as annotating a method with @KafkaListener, specifying which topics to subscribe to.
* `Processing Data`: Once a message is received, our diligent Kafka Consumer processes it. This could involve updating a database, performing a calculation, or even triggering other processes within your Spring Boot application. It's like the postal worker ensuring the right mail gets to the right department for action.
* `Acknowledging Messages`: After processing the message, the consumer acknowledges it, ensuring that it doesn't get processed again. This is like the postal worker marking a package as delivered.

## Use Cases

* `Event-Driven Systems`: Just like city departments need to react to specific events (e.g., a power outage), applications can use Kafka Consumers to react to events happening within or outside the application, enabling real-time responsiveness.
* `Microservices Communication`: In a city full of specialized departments, Kafka Consumers allow different microservices to communicate effectively, each microservice processing its relevant messages.
* `Log Aggregation`: Similar to collecting reports from various city departments, Kafka Consumers can be used to aggregate logs from multiple services, providing a unified view of what's happening across an application landscape.
Stream Processing: While Kafka Streams is more specialized for this, Kafka Consumers can still be used in a more manual, lower-level form of stream processing, filtering, and aggregating data streams.

## Current example

In this case the application is simply reading the outcome from the stream application[^1] in this same sandbox, and posting 
it into the application log.
